# Chinook Customer Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior, revenue trends, and purchasing patterns using the Chinook relational database. The goal is to extract business insights using SQL queries that simulate real-world data analysis tasks.

---

## Dataset
The dataset is the Chinook database, which represents a digital media store with multiple related tables including:

- Customers
- Invoices
- InvoiceItems
- Tracks
- Albums
- Artists
- Genres

This structure allows complex relational queries similar to real company databases.

- Who are the top spending customers?
- Which countries generate the most revenue?
- What genres sell the most?
- What is the average customer purchase value?
- Which customers make repeat purchases?

## Key Insights
- Customer Spending Patterns:
  
   A small subset of customers contributes the majority of total revenue, indicating a high-value customer segment.

   Average invoice value varies significantly between customers, suggesting different purchasing behaviors.

- Regional Purchasing Trends:
 
   Top-spending customers differ by country, showing that revenue drivers are geographically segmented.

   Certain countries have multiple top customers tied in spending, indicating competitive markets rather than single dominant buyers.

- Genre Preferences:

   Customer spending varies widely across genres, suggesting strong individual music preferences.

   Some genres have multiple top spenders, indicating shared popularity rather than niche appeal.

- Track Popularity by Region:
  
   The most purchased track differs across countries, showing regional differences in music taste.

   Track popularity is not globally uniform — local trends strongly influence sales.
